public class HelloJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hhi cuh");
    }
}




//every file needs the keyword 'class' and the class name which would be HelloJava, the class name must be the same as the file name

//the public keyword means it is accessible to other classes

//the main method is the entry point to the java application when the app starts it looks for the main method public static void main(String[] args) { }

//System.out.println("hello cuh");
//println() prints to the console
        
// another way to print your code to the terminal:
// open the the terminal to the folder where your project lives and type: javac HelloJava.java (HelloJava is the file name) - this compiles your code
// then type: java HelloJava (HelloJava is the file name) - this runs the code
// OR i can just press the run button
